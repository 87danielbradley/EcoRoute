# EcoRoute

## Background and Overview
Built with the MERN stack, EcoRoute addresses the age-old question of, “Where should we meet?” while also providing a tool to help people plan out a busy day of errands.  

## Functionality and MVP 
Optimizes a list of address inputs by distance/time.
Users will be able to create events where invitees can accept or decline the invitation. By providing a general meeting place, EcoRoute will be able to recommend the most equidistant location to the users attending.
